# home-price-prediction
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of a house based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, availability of air conditioning, furnishing status, and more.

Using a structured dataset sourced from Kaggle, the system applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning algorithms to uncover patterns in housing data and estimate property prices.


#Algorithms Used
Linear Regression
A simple algorithm that models the linear relationship between the features and the price. Acts as a baseline model.

Random Forest Regressor
An ensemble model that improves accuracy by combining the predictions of multiple decision trees. Handles non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.


#Dataset Features
From the Housing Price Prediction dataset on Kaggle, each record includes:

area (square feet)

bedrooms, bathrooms, stories

mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning (yes/no)

parking (number of spots)

prefarea (preferred location: yes/no)

furnishingstatus (semi-furnished, unfurnished, furnished)

price (target variable)
